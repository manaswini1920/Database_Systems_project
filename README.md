# Introduction: Project Overview:

The global effect of the Coronavirus epidemic was enormous. Food delivery services have become an important part of our everyday life. It is critical for institutions like UNCC to maintain track of the visitors and authorized personnel that come to campus every day. We have created Campus_Eats_Fall2020 database which represents as a small sized restaurant. It contains all the data required to function a restaurant properly. This project involves designing a database to store the details of the delivery, driver, faculty, location, order, person, restaurant, staff, student and vehicle. Users can search for restaurants and place orders. The order will be assigned to a delivery person.
  
# Business Rules:

Each user can rate Order, Driver and Food.Â 
Each order can have 3 kinds of rating.
Each order can have one driver rating.
Each order can have one food rating.
Each order has an Overall Rating.
Each driver can have many rating.
Each restaurant food can have many rating.
