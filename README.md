# AIM of the project
Our Aim is to understand a test database for a campus controlled food delivery service similar to craveoncampus.com and to enhance the database with a rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers. This is extending a prototype for the database not a fully implemented working model. We will be designing  and adding tables to include a rating system.

# Project Overview:

Food delivery systems have become a crucial part of our daily lives. For universities such as UNCC, it is important to keep track of visitors and authorized personals who are on campus each day. We have Campus_Eats_Fall2020 database which represents as a small sized restaurant. It contains all the data required to function a restaurant properly. This project involves designing a database to store the details of the delivery, driver, faculty, location, order, person, restaurant,staff, student and vehicle. Users can search for restaurants and place orders. The order will be assigned to a delivery person.
